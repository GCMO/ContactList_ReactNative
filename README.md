# ContactList_ReactNative

## OVERVIEW

Simple standard React Native beginner project. Two screens: Contacts and Details. Clink on each customer in the Contacts screen 
and be directed to the details of that specific customer (image, name, mobile, email, city).

## OBJECTIVE

This is my first approach to React Native Development, the aim was to produce a small app in the shortest time possible: This today 8h.
Overall Im satisfied of this first approach

## LEARNING CURVE

- React and React Native work similarly, specially as far as components, props and states goes. However the whole UX and navigation btw 
screens is coded and experience differently. <tag> may do the same thing but have different names and <styles> seem to be coded within 
each components as a standard practice (that kinda annoys me, prefer to have separate files for each component). Essential to install
snippets for VSCode.
- Extreme attention and following documentation its required to setup the environment. Expo is not in its perfection and packages show
conflicts, specially while compiling in node_modules. Had to npm install twice. On top of that many ReactNative elements require their
own packages, so again documentation it is essential in knowing what to install and when.
- Installation of Android SDK and Xcode is very time consuming and somewhat conbersome. Difficult to understand what is happening under 
the hoood. 
- Very difficult and time consuming to deploy to GPlayStore and AppleStore, something that I'll do at a later stage when Ive got a good
development of a full app.
